# Coding Challenges

## Problem 1 - The Longest Word (Easy)

> For a given input string of words, create a function that returns the longest word in the string,
> along with the number of characters in the word.
> If there are two or more words that are the same length, return the first word from the string.

> Examples:
>
> Input: This is a simple coding challenge \
> Output: challenge : 9
>
> Input: My name is John Doe \
> Output: name : 4 \
> Explanation: name comes before John, and both have the same length.

## Problem 2 - Tidy Number (Medium)

> Given a number, the task is to check if it is tidy or not. \
> A tidy number is a number whose digits are in non-decreasing order.

> Examples:
>
> Input: 1234 \
> Output: true
>
> Input: 1243 \
> Output: false \
> Explanation: Digits "4" and "3 violate the property"

> Only lowercase letters are considered.
>
> Input: [a, b, c, e] \
> Output: d
>
> Input: [o, q, r, s] \
